                    So as an update, the game I was trying to make for the gamejam didn't end up getting remotely finished. However, I feel it was a huge learning experience regardless of that. My friend got really hung up on doing a whole physics system which didn't allow us to actually implement anything playable. I think it was a great experience though. The things I learned from the experience were really rewarding anyway.<br><br>

                    In the mean time, I have pretty much been working on this portfolio site! I had been wanting to make my own portfolio without a template for a while, and finally decided I wanted to do it. So for the past few weeks this is what I have been doing. I especially wanted some form of an interactive/game on my main page. And thus we have the 'A Damien Jacobson Game', a very basic 'game' where you interact with signs to find out more about me. I have a huge passion for programming, and gamedev, so it was a fun little project to do. I made all the sprites myself that I am using for another game I plan on fully developing using Pygame. So keep an eye out for that!<br><br>

                    So as a quick overview of what I've added to my portfolio site, I've added an <a href="../about.html">About</a> page which talks a bit more about myself, along with a small list of things I like. I also have a <a href="../skills.html">Skills</a> page which lists the languages I know, and tools I use. And alongside that is my <a href="../projects.html">Projects</a> page, which shows off some of my projects, along with their Live links and Repos. Then obviously my blog, and lastly an <a href="../art.html">Art</a> page to show some of my art. That is really just a little bonus thing I wanted to include.<br><br>

                    In any case, I hope you enjoy my portfolio! It has been a fun project to work on and I intend to keep working on it.<br><br>
