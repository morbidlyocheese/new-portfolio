                <p class="body_content">About a month or so ago I attended a workshop, provided by my bootcamp, about making small applications just using vanilla JS/HTML/CSS. After attending that workshop it had me thinking I wanted to do more of that, but specifically working on an idea I had for a while.<br><br>
                
                If you know me, you'll know I am horror obsessed and I love to review the films I watch on <a href="http://letterboxd.com">Letterboxd</a>. I use the site pretty religiously to keep track of all the films I watch but also to review them. And while I love using the website, I had always sort of wanted to have my own review site to expand on the reviews I wrote on their site. So that is exactly what I ended up doing. <br><br>

                I decided to make the entire website just using vanilla JS/HTML/CSS like I had used for the workshop project. It was a way for me to go back to the basics of everything I learned and to try to solidify that knowledge. All while making a fun project I had wanted to make for ages. It was definitely a fun learning experience and I plan to continue updating it with new reviews. <br><br>

                But along with reviews, I decided I wanted it to also be a place to create a gallery of gifs I have made over the years. Back when Tumblr was my main source of browsing, I had a horror blog where I posted gifs. It was something I thoroughly enjoyed doing, but as time went on Tumblr started to become less fun, and making horror gifs started being a thing you couldn't really post because of the gore. So I dropped it, but was left with folders of all the gifs I made. I missed making them, and honestly just wanted a place to look at them other than on my hard drive. So I made a section on the site just for that. At the moment there isn't a lot on there, but I will add more to it as I go just like with the reviews. It is just a bit of a process. <br><br>

                If you'd like to check out my review site then you can <a href="http://horroreview.netlify.com">go here.</a> <br><br>
